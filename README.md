# Api for libraries

## API for libraries (books, not codes), the plan is to establish a backend to be consumed by react and kotlin apps. But it should work with anything else.

## Prerequisites

NPM, YARN and GIT installed. You will also need access to a mariaDB or MySQL database. For other databases, changes to migrations and entities may be required.

---

## Install


Clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jppatriciovnlc/library-back-api.git
```

Create a ormconfig.json file in library-back-api folder:
```json
{
    "type": "mysql",
    "host": "endere√ßo do servidor (ip o dns)",
    "port": 3306,
    "username": "usuario",
    "password": "senha",
    "database": "library",
    "migrations": ["src/database/migrations/*.ts"],   
    "entities": ["src/database/entities/*.ts"],
    "cli": {
       "migrationsDir": "src/database/migrations",
       "entitiesDir": "src/database/entities"
    }
 }
```

Install the dependencies:
```bash
$ yarn install
```

Create the database tables (the library schema must exists):
```bash
$ yarn typeorm migration:run
```

Start the API in dev mode:
```bash
$ yarn dev
```

Enjoy it! The server will start in the localhost:3000
